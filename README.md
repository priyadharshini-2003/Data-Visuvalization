Project Summary: Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard

I developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze sales and profit performance using Superstore data.

  Data Source
- A CSV file containing Superstore data, including fields such as:
  - Order Date, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Customer Information.

 Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed data using  Power Query Editor
  - Removed duplicates and null values.
  - Formatted date fields.
  - Created calculated columns and measures (e.g., Total Sales, Profit Margin).
  - Filtered unnecessary fields for optimized performance.

 Dashboard Components

 1. Sales Analysis Dashboard
- KPIs: Total Sales, Average Sales per Order, Sales by Category.
- Visuals:
  - Line chart showing monthly sales trends.
  - Bar chart comparing sales by region and category.
  - Donut chart for sales contribution by sub-category.
  - Slicers for filtering by year, region, and category.

 2. Profit Analysis Dashboard
- KPIs: Total Profit, Profit Margin, Loss-making Products.
- Visuals:
  - Bar chart showing profit by category and sub-category.
  - Heat map to identify profitable vs. unprofitable regions.
  - Scatter plot of Sales vs Profit to detect outliers.
   

 Insights Derived
- Identified high-performing regions and categories driving sales.
- Highlighted low-profit categories and loss-making sub-categories.
- Discovered seasonal sales trends and regional variations in performance.

 Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop (Power Query, DAX, and interactive visuals)
